# Programming Portfolio

Programming portfolio, written with create-react-app. It documents pretty much everything I have ever coded, from my start in web dev with Weebly all the way through my rocket simulations. I wrote it to look a bit like an RPG player card, but it pretty much turned into a series of descriptions summarizing my life.

Run the app with `react-scripts start`.
