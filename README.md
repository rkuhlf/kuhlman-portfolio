# Kuhlman Portfolio

Portfolio for Riley Kuhlman, written with create-react-app and a lot of CSS. It documents pretty much everything I have ever coded, from my start in web dev with Weebly all the way through my rocket simulations. I wrote it to look a bit like an RPG player card, but it pretty much turned into a series of essays summarizing my life.
